    "text": "Introduction\nAs a developer from a background with .NET and Microsoft tools, it comes as no surprise that I use Windows as my development platform. However, developing on Windows has never been better. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows a developer to essentially to right at home with linux, arguably the best contemporary platform for developing.\nAs an R user, being able to develop on the linux platform and using RStudio IDE as a Windows users is a winning prospect. Fortunately, this has been made possible by RStudio and they wrote a lenthly blog post.\nMy blog post is just a brief outline of steps and references for getting RStudio server on WSL2."

Enter the following command in WSL2:\nwget https://rstudio.org/download/latest/stable/server/bionic/rstudio-server-latest-amd64.deb sudo gdebi rstudio-server-latest-amd64.deb\nAdditionally, you can use the server itself by the accessing RStudio on your web browser at the url http://localhost:8787. You will need to enter in your your username and password that is used for the linux system on WSL."
